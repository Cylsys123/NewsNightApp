      "Picked favourites, and standing steadfast by them, during the awards season is a form of masochism. For these annual self-congratulation rituals breed a ton of frustration, and provide rare satisfaction. It reaches a flashpoint right after the Oscar nominations are announced. Some flock to social media to air their outrage. Others, like me, grumble to themselves, or the nearest ally they can find. Each snap always feels like a personal slight somehow. NEWLIN3  NEWLIN3 Yet, each year, so much energy is invested in this ultimately meaningless exercise. The Grammys and Oscars being “ratings disasters” are such a familiar headline, but you're still watching. You know they are not about excellence, but economics. But you're still rooting for that dark horse. More often than not, it won't even get nominated. On the rare occasion it does, and rarer still it wins, external reinforcement never tasted so sweet. NEWLIN3  NEWLIN3 The 93rd Academy Awards had its considerable share of snubs. It had some surprises too. The nominees were not so white. More than one woman was nominated for Best Director for the first time. Two lead stars were nominated in the supporting actor category. Unlike the glitchy Golden Globes on Zoom, the Oscars will be an in-person ceremony. So, expect the usual pomp and pageantry. Agents and producers will be thanked, and long speeches will be cut off by “wrap it up” music. NEWLIN3  NEWLIN3 On cue, I try to predict how the 9000-odd Academy members will vote in for the Best Picture. I will also look at nominees that should win but won't, and those that should have been contenders but aren't. NEWLIN3  NEWLIN3 Best Picture NEWLIN3  NEWLIN3 Nomadland quickly gathered steam as the film to beat, once it followed up top crowns at Venice and Toronto with a win at the Golden Globes. Now boosted by PGA, DGA and BAFTA wins, Chloé Zhao's meditative vision of life on the road is a near-certainty for Best Picture at the Oscars. The one film which could cause an upset is Aaron Sorkin's showier The Trial of the Chicago 7. David Fincher's Mank is the kind of loving homage to old Hollywood that the Academy is usually a sucker for. Think back to The Artist, Argo or even The Shape of Water. Emerald Fennell's vigilante thriller Promising Young Woman too seems unlikely to win, even though it is only about as edgy as the Academy can handle. Nomadland is the easier sell without doubt. The weight of recent history on its side, it has connected with critics, voters and the general public. Of the titles in contention, my own pick is Minari. Of those not in contention, it has to be First Cow. The three films from Zhao, Lee Isaac Chung and Kelly Reichardt (respectively) are all about the same thing in a way: people trying to survive on the fringes of society chasing the American Dream. If Minari cuts deeper than Nomadland (at least for me), First Cow resonates longer, and looks destined to endure as a classic of American cinema. NEWLIN3",
